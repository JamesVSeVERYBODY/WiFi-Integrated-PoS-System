# Integrating Mikrotik into Wi-Fi POS System

## Mikrotik's Role in the System

A Mikrotik router can serve multiple crucial functions in your Wi-Fi POS system:

1. Wi-Fi Access Point
2. DHCP Server
3. Captive Portal Host
4. Firewall
5. Network Address Translation (NAT)
6. Quality of Service (QoS) Management

## Key Features of Mikrotik for This System

1. HotSpot Feature: Built-in captive portal functionality.
2. User Manager: Manage user accounts and access.
3. Scripting: Automate tasks using Mikrotik's scripting language.
4. API: RESTful API for integration with external systems.
5. VLAN Support: Segment network for enhanced security.
6. Bandwidth Management: Control internet usage per user.

## Implementation Steps

1. Basic Setup:
   - Configure Mikrotik as your primary router
   - Set up Wi-Fi using the built-in wireless capabilities or external APs

2. HotSpot Configuration:
   - Enable HotSpot feature on the Wi-Fi interface
   - Customize the login page to accept QR code input

3. User Management:
   - Use User Manager for creating temporary accounts
   - Set up profiles with time-limited access

4. API Integration:
   - Enable Mikrotik's API
   - Develop integration between your POS system and Mikrotik's API

5. Scripting for Automation:
   - Create scripts to automatically add/remove users based on POS transactions
   - Set up scripts for cleaning up expired user accounts

6. Security Measures:
   - Configure firewall rules to isolate customer traffic
   - Set up VLANs to separate POS network from customer Wi-Fi

7. QoS Configuration:
   - Implement bandwidth limits for fair usage
   - Prioritize traffic for optimal performance

## Sample Mikrotik Script (Pseudo-code)

```
# This script adds a new user when triggered by the POS system
:local username "customer123"
:local password "qr12345"
:local timelimit "1h"

/ip hotspot user add name=$username password=$password limit-uptime=$timelimit

# Additional logic can be added for removing users, checking status, etc.
```

## Integration Workflow

1. Customer makes a purchase at POS
2. POS system generates a unique username/password or token
3. POS system calls Mikrotik API to create a new HotSpot user
4. QR code with login info is printed on receipt
5. Customer scans QR code on HotSpot login page
6. Mikrotik authenticates user and grants time-limited access
7. After time limit, Mikrotik automatically removes user access

## Considerations

- Scalability: Ensure your Mikrotik model can handle the expected number of concurrent users
- Security: Regularly update RouterOS and follow best practices for securing your Mikrotik device
- Compliance: Ensure your setup complies with local regulations regarding public Wi-Fi access
- Backup: Regularly backup your Mikrotik configuration
- Monitoring: Set up logging and monitoring to track usage and troubleshoot issues

Remember to thoroughly test your setup before full deployment, and consider consulting with a Mikrotik certified professional for complex implementations.
